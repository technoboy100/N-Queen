# N-Queen
 The N Queens problem is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics that involves placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other. In other words, no two queens can be in the same row, column, or diagonal.

Here's a description of the problem:

Problem Statement: Given an integer N, find all possible arrangements of N queens on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.

Input: An integer N representing the size of the chessboard and the number of queens to be placed.

Output: All possible solutions, each represented as an N×N matrix where 1 indicates the presence of a queen and 0 indicates an empty cell.

Example:

Copy code
Input: N = 4
Output: [
 [0, 1, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 1, 0]
]
This problem is typically solved using backtracking algorithms such as recursive depth-first search (DFS). The algorithm starts by placing a queen in the first row and then recursively tries to place queens in the subsequent rows, checking if the placement is valid at each step. If a valid arrangement is found, it is added to the list of solutions.

Here's a high-level approach to solving the N Queens problem:

Start with an empty chessboard.
Place a queen in the first row.
Move to the next row and try to place a queen in each column.
Check if the queen placement is valid (i.e., it doesn't threaten any other queens).
If a valid placement is found, move to the next row and repeat steps 3-4.
If no valid placement is found in a row, backtrack to the previous row and try a different column.
Repeat steps 3-6 until all queens are placed or all possibilities are exhausted.
Once all possible solutions are found, they can be returned as the output.
